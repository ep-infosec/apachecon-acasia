### How can I publish the website to ApacheCon
First you need to write access right of [ApacheCon website](https://svn.apache.org/repos/infra/apachecon/www.apachecon.com/acasia2022/)

Checking out the this repo
```
git@github.com:alc-beijing/acasia-website.git <source-directory>
```

Checking out the content of website to <site-directory>
```
svn co https://svn.apache.org/repos/infra/apachecon/www.apachecon.com/acasia2022/ <site-directory>
```

After doing some modifications on the markdown files, you can use hugo command to generate the website from the source directory

cd <source-directory>
hugo -b https://apachecon.com/acasia2022/ -d <site-directory> -F
```

Publishing the website
```
cd <site-directory>
svn ci -m "Publish the website of acasia2022"
```

### How can I modify the content of the main page:

It's under `content/_index.md`

### How can I have translations:

Add new language to the `config.toml`:

```
[languages.zh]
languageName = "中文"
weight = 2
```

And create language specific version for each content file:

```
content/_index.md
content/_index.zh.md
content/cfp.md
content/cfp.zh.md
```

### How can I modify the menu?

For simple links, add the menu entry to the `config.toml`:

(Note: add it for all the active languages)

```
[[languages.en.menu.main]]
name = "t-shirt"
url = "https://s.apache.org/apache-tshirt"
weight = -110
```

The most page links of the menu are generated from the markdown files of content directory.
For a page, it's enough to add a menu entry to the markdown (For example `content/cfp.md`):

```
---
title: Call for Presentations
menu:
  main:
    weight: -300
---
...
...
```

You can add or remove the links from navigation bar by adding or removing this menu entry.
