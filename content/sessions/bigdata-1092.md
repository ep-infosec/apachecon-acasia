When you hear "decision-maker," it's natural to think of "C-suite" or "executive." 

But these days, we're all decision-makers. Restaurant owners, bloggers, big-box shoppers, and diners have important decisions to make and need instant actionable insights. Businesses need access to fast, fresh analytics to provide these insights to end-users like us. 

In this session, we will learn how to build our own real-time analytics application on top of a streaming data source using Apache Kafka, Apache Pinot, and Streamlit. Kafka is a distributed, open-source pub-sub messaging and streaming platform for real-time workloads, Pinot is an OLAP database designed for ultra-low latency analytics, and Streamlit is a Python-based tool that makes it easy to build data-driven apps.

After introducing these tools, we'll stream data into Kafka using its Python client, ingest that data into a Pinot real-time table, and write basic queries using Pinot's Python SDK. Once we've done that, we'll bring everything together with an auto-refreshing Streamlit dashboard to see changes to the data as they happen. There will be lots of graphs and other visualizations!

This session is aimed at application developers and data engineers who want to quickly make sense of streaming data.
