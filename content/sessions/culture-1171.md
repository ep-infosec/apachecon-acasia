The Apache Way is a culture and spirit which guides not only how to make good open-source software, but how to run a good developer community and user group as well.
SegmentFault is the leading developer community in China, where tens of millions of developers share their development experiences every month.
In this talk, as the Co-Founder of SegmentFault, I will share with you:
What do we understand the community is?
How do we govern the content-based developer community in an open-source way? 
How has that given us a unique advantage and high growth?

I have served Microsoft, AWS, Google, Baidu, Alibaba Cloud, and other leading companies to help build their technology brand and developer ecosystem. And I started my open-source journey in 2019 by supporting or organizing open-source events, such as COSCon, OpenInfra Days China, and ApacheCon Asia. I hope I can be a bridge to help more people enter the world of open source and enjoy their completely different and more efficient development here than ever before.
