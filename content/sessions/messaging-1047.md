Message queue is the pipeline connecting and decoupling various heterogeneous data systems. Based on the RocketMQ community and its own research, Xiaomi has built a set of highly available and high-performance online messaging platform for integration, industrial and commercial scenarios, which can significantly reduce users' access costs.
This article will share common application scenarios and data scale, and then introduce the best practices of messaging platform construction, including high availability, performance optimization, disaster recovery, observability, resource optimization, DevOPS, heterogeneous data source integration, Schema and other related content. Finally, a brief description of future planning will be given. It includes storage separation, hierarchical storage, metadata self-management, and storage layer optimization.
