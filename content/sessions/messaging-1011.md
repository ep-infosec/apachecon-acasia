In this talk I will walk through how to build different types of streaming applications utilizing Apache NiFi, Apache Flink, Apache Spark and Apache Pulsar together.   

We will ingest various data and REST feeds to enrich and send to Apache Pulsar.   We will build applications on top of this live streaming data with Web socket dashboards, Apache Spark SQL ETL and Apache Flink continuous SQL.

We will also ingest IoT sensor data from various devices and stream directly to Apache Pulsar via MQTT and native Pulsar protocol.

Finally at the end of this talk, developers will walk away with the What, How and Why of building this apps.
