In recent times, the demand for time-critical short-lived interactive spark workloads has grown tremendously. One common use case is that of data preparation wherein a pipeline of data integration steps is built through spark driven interactions with subset of data (data worksheet) and visualizing the transforming data responses in real time. This recipe of interactive spark queries is then published to be applied on petabytes of data at hyperscale.

Informatica supports these use cases through deep integration with Apache Livy on a managed Kubernetes cluster. This session will cover in detail the enhancements made to Apache Livy SDK for supporting concurrent asynchronous submission of spark code snippets (statements). Deep dive of the framework will cover the lazy deployment of Livy server as a Kubernetes service, the optimizations made in the client agent application to achieve sub second queries dispatch, and a new Java’s *CompletableFuture* based listener for asynchronous queries monitoring and results retrieval. In this talk, we will also discuss how the framework prioritizes and supports fail-fast quick dispatch mode over traditional batch workflow demands like job recovery, cluster state correctness, and lazy job resources availability to describe a few. Finally, we will summarize observed performance gains regarding job runtime achieved by this framework over a regular Spark job.
