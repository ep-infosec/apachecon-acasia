Time-series data is an important asset in the industry and is widely used in many scenarios. In the case of rail transit, time-series data are used to detect and reinforce the bridge state (deflection, strain, vibration and support displacement) to avoid the collapse of the bridge and ensure the safety of people's travel. 

In the energy management and control scenario, real-time data are used to monitor energy consumption, alarm management and forecast optimization of chemical plants, so as to realize energy saving, emission reduction and efficiency enhancement and respond to "carbon peak" and "carbon neutrality". 

In the intelligent manufacturing scenario, time-series data is used to improve production efficiency, realize manufacturing page transformation and upgrading, and respond to the call of Made in China 2025 through monitoring equipment status and statistical process control. The IoTDB time-series database provides a complete, reliable, low-cost, lightweight solution around these requirements. IoTDB Workbench provides all the basic functions of IOTDB-CLI client, and on this basis, added data visualization, real-time display of monitoring data and other functions.

IoTDB database, as a top-level project of Apache ASF, has been used in over one million terminal devices worldwide. The introduction of IoTDB Workbench will serve IoTDB more effectively, including but not limited to rich aggregation function library, efficient realization of data management visualization, monitoring operation and maintenance visualization functions.

The O&M monitoring function ensures reliable database running, including JVM, CPU, memory, storage, and query indicators, displays slow query statement information, and downloads slow query logs. It greatly reduces the operation and maintenance cost of operation and maintenance personnel and facilitates the visual management of IoTDB database.
