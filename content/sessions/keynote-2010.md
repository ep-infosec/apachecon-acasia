As an important part of the digital economy, digital governance and digital sovereignty, open source governance has become an important strategic choice for the digital development of a country, region, enterprise or organization. And a variety of best practice models of open source governance have emerged, such as Apache Way and the OSPOlogy methodology of TODO Group have provided an excellent reference for the development of global open source governance for our country. This Panel gathers some core members of the "Open Source Strategy Research Group" (ONES Group) of Kaiyuanshe, and discusses the experiences of open source governance in my country from different perspectives such as enterprise open source governance, foundation open source governance, and open source community governance. and provide constructive opinions on national open source governance standards, enterprise OSPO organization construction, digital tools for open source governance, and talent training for open source governance, hoping to inspire everyone.
