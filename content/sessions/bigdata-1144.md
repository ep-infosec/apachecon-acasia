In September 2021, Apache Kylin community released Kylin 4.0, a new generation product of Kylin, which uses Parquet to replace HBase to simplify the architecture and realize the separation of storage and computation. At present, there are many users in the community who choose to upgrade to the new version and get a good use experience.
At the same time, the Kylin community is also planning the next generation of Kylin. On the one hand, Kylin's predictive computing engine and model metadata are optimized to greatly improve the flexibility of model design. On the other hand, Kylin actively embraces the latest technology trends and redesigns and implements Kylin's computing engine and deployment architecture from the perspective of Native Engine and microservices. In this sharing, Mr. Yu Xiaoxiang, PMC Member of Kylin community, will bring you a forward-looking introduction and demonstration of the next generation of Kylin technology. The agenda is as follows:
1. Introduction to Kylin technology and overview of Kylin 4.1.0 features
2. Roadmap introduction of the next generation of Kylin
- Flexible metadata design
- Native Engine
- Microservices and cloud native
3. Technical preview demo
