Apache Ranger has widely been used as an authorization service for most of the products like HDFS, HIVE, HBASE etc in Apache Hadoop ecosystem for on-premise clusters. In this talk, we want to discuss various use cases on how Ranger policies can be leveraged to perform fine-grained authorization for objects stored in S3 public cloud storage along with capability to view access audits.
