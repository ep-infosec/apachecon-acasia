Protecting your APIs is no easy task. As the size of your APIs increase, so does the overhead that comes with adding security to each of your endpoints.

A solution is to setup an API gateway like Apache APISIX, which accepts all the requests to your APIs and in turn calls the various APIs required to fulfil the request and return the appropriate response.

APISIX can also protect your APIs by being the central system that handles authentication, authorization, rate-limiting, logging and monitoring.

In this talk, Navendu introduces Apache APISIX and how development teams can leverage them to easily build secure APIs.
