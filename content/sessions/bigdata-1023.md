Apache Linkis(Incubating) builds a layer of computing middleware between upper-layer applications and lower-layer engines, providing computing governance capabilities such as connectivity, control, extension, and orchestration. In this speech, Di Shuai will introduce how Linkis provides convenience for more efficient and low-cost connected diversified computing and storage engines (such as Python, Spark, Flink, etc.), and how to solve computing governance problems such as multi-tenant isolation, high concurrency, new engine adaptation, and high-risk operation control. At the same time, Di Shuai will show some exciting work currently being carried out by Linkis community and the follow-up planning of Linkis.
