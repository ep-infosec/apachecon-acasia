Apache SkyWalking supports custom metrics and integration with the mainstream metrics ecology and provides a meter system for metrics analysis and calculation. MAL(Meter Analysis Language) is the language that sets these rules for analyzing. Users can use it to perform analytical calculations on these source metrics. In this proposal will share:
- What is the MAL, and what scenarios should use it.
- MAL's basic data flow and syntax format.
- How to analyze metrics by MAL.
- VMs monitoring practices by MAL.
- Kubernetes monitoring practices by MAL.
