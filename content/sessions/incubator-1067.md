Tison is a full member of the Apache Software Foundation and Committer on multiple Apache projects. Tison was involved in Apache Inlong (Incubator) incubation as a founding member, and in Apache Kvrocks (Incubator) incubation as mentor, helping to establish and develop the open source community. In this topic, Tison will discuss from his own experience why he should choose Apache Incubator as an open source participant and why he should choose to donate to Apache Incubator as an enterprise open source decision maker.
