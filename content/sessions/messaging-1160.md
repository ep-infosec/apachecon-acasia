In the online business scenario, RocketMQ has been verified by Alibaba's Singles' Day for many years, and then widely adopted by most of China's Top Internet and financial enterprises in the core production system, honing the ultimate performance, ease of use and stability. RocketMQ doesn't stop there, however. In the latest version of 5.0, the RocketMQ storage tier has a number of new features, including Batch, LogicQueue, CompactTopic, and more. These features are the culmination of RocketMQ's efforts in streaming storage. Zhendong Liu, PMC Member from Apache RocketMQ community, will share with you the thinking, judgment and practice path behind this conference.

From open source to business, he has been working in the messaging space for the past few years. I have been involved in the open source community since the incubation of Apache RocketMQ. In the early days, I was mainly involved in code sorting and small feature optimization in the community. In the middle period, I contributed a multi-copy version of Raft implementation (DLedger version) to the RocketMQ community, which was later optimized by the community and widely used in production systems. Recently, based on my own practice in the field of streaming storage, Enhancements to the RocketMQ community include a number of stream storage features, including Batch and LogicQueue. Passionate about the open source community, actively helping newcomers to the community to integrate and contribute, shared many times on RocketMQ Meetup. I am happy to share the latest stream storage practices here at ApacheCon Asia.
