Developing a highly-available application requires more than just utilizing fault-tolerant services such as Apache Pulsar in your software stack. It also requires immediate failure detection and resolution including built-in failover when there are data center outages.

Up until now, Pulsar clients could only interact with a single Pulsar cluster and were unable to detect and respond to a cluster-level failure event. In the event of a complete cluster failure, these clients cannot reroute their messages to a secondary/standby cluster automatically.

With the release of Pulsar 2.10, this much-needed automated cluster failover capability has been added to the Pulsar client libraries. In this talk, I will walk you through the changes you need to make inside your application code to take advantage of this new capability.
