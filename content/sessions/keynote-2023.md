Miya Liu,
In 2015, Miya started her community building journey by creating a platform for ordinary people to share their stories. She then joined freeCodeCamp.org, the world's largest open source community helping people learn to code for free, and grew from a volunteer to the Chinese community ambassador, collaborating with people around the world for free education. She focuses on education charity, social innovation, and youth development, and loves to spread good stories, believing that the joy from the heart is what drives people to continue to do good.
