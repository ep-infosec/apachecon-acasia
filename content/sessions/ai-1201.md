Data processing platforms and deep learning frameworks are both evolving in their respective fields. Apache Spark is typically used for offline data processing, followed by various deep learning frameworks for data reasoning. The simplified API for DL reasoning is important as a bridge.

What would the ideal data and deep learning inference pipeline look like? We'll discuss how to build your AI applications using Spark and ONNX, the current status and initial ideas of the Spark community to improve this pipeline, and take advantage of the Ascend Hardware Platform.

The conference will include the following sections:
- How to get through the process of big data and AI reasoning?
- What is ONNX, help hardware acceleration enable.
- Introduced the "SPIP: Simplified API for DL Inferencing" background to the Spark community
- A simple demo to show how it works.

This topic helps you understand the latest progress in integrating the Ascend Hardware Platform into ONNX and the Spark community's initial ideas for improving the inference pipeline.
