JD retail data and intelligence department build a flink-based real-time computing framework based on JD’s business characteristics to improve the development efficiency of r&d personnel in specific scenarios. It is committed to building unique flink-based data flow scenarios, including but not limited to:

1) List scenario: committed to solving multi-stream Join scenario and TopN scenario

2) Query moving line analysis scenario: Flink Gelly is used to drop the data of graph analysis results into OLAP for multidimensional analysis, and then start streaming analysis to Query OLAP for data analysts to provide AB causality analysis for QP scenario and other technical points, mainly share some machine learning engineering and related data analysis technology scenarios and corresponding solutions accumulated by jd Retail Data and Intelligence Department

3) Machine learning scenario: Dedicated to the construction of a unique machine learning workflow based on Flink, internal machine learning link closed loop, including but not limited to real-time feature generation, sample splicing, feature engineering, model training, model estimation and other links, full link batch integration, multiplexing operator.
