RocketMQ has been Apache TLP since 2017, making it the preferred messaging service for vendors with high performance, low latency, and high reliability. In 2021, Apache RocketMQ was upgraded to become a cloud-native "message, event, and stream" converged processing platform. At the same time, RoccketMQ's high availability architecture has evolved into a next-generation converged architecture that can handle multiple scenarios such as "message," "event," and "stream" simultaneously. This presentation will introduce the evolution of Apache RocketMQ high availability architecture and the decryption of RocketMQ 5.0 converged high availability architecture, including the master-slave architecture upgrade to support messaging scenarios and the new pluggable switching architecture to support real-time computing and sequential messaging scenarios.
