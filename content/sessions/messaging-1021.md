In many use cases, applications are using Pulsar consumers or readers to fetch all the updates from a topic and construct a map with the latest value of each key for the messages that were received. 

The new TableView consumer offers support for this access pattern directly in the Pulsar client API itself, and encapsulates the complexities of manually constructing such local cache manually. In this talk, we will demonstrate how to use the new TableView consumer using a simple application and discuss best practices and patterns for using the TableView consumer.
