Democratizing the ability to build streaming data pipelines will help turn everyone who needs streaming data to be able to do it themselves.   By utilizing the open source streaming stack known as FLiPNS will let us achieve this.

	FLiPNS is a stack of Apache Flink, Apache Pulsar, Apache Spark and Apache NiFi.   Apache NiFi provides a Web UI for cseâ€™s to build their own data pipelines.   These citizen applications can be used to ingest data, route, transform, enrich, join and store it.   As part of these applications Pulsar will provide a streaming data hub for ML model access as well as plugging in additional processing components.
