At present, there are many pain points in existing company platforms: each platform only has basic and fragmented metadata, without establishing correlation; The relationship between metadata does not have an effective analysis and application; Lack of "thousands of faces" tag capability, unable to flexibly mark application/resource/domain name metadata. Companies urgently need a metadata platform that can extract and analyze various relational data; In this context, we chose HugeGraph graph data from Baidu, and made deep integration and secondary development to create Huya application metadata platform: build a dynamic relationship network of huya applications and resources; On this basis, AI and big data are combined for intelligent retrieval and analysis, so as to horizontally break through the measurement relationship between applications and resources, and vertically build a one-stop visual metadata management and analysis platform for intelligent analysis of application architecture rationality and application labels.
This sharing focuses on the specific practice and case sharing of HugeGraph graph data in hutooth application metadata project. The content of sharing includes: application metadata requirement background and solution, application metadata platform technical scheme selection, graph database secondary development and deep integration, graph database in application metadata project business practice sharing, etc.
