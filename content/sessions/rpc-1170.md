With the advent of the cloud native era, infrastructure capabilities are being unleashed upward, and platforms like Kubernetes are integrating microservices concept abstractions.
The service discovery model based on interface granularity in Dubbo 2.x is completely inconsistent with the service discovery model based on application granularity abstracted by other platforms, resulting in the failure of Dubbo users to natively connect to governance systems such as Kubernetes.
The application-level service discovery model in Dubbo 3.0 was developed to adapt to this architecture. After migrating to the application-level service discovery model in Dubbo 3.0, applications naturally have the ability to apply service discovery models to other ecosystems.
This presentation will break down the design philosophy and principles of the application-level service discovery model in Dubbo 3.0.
