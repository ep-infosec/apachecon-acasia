Machine learning (ML) is the study of computer algorithms that can improve automatically through experience and by the use of data. Machine learning algorithms build a model based on sample data, known as training data, in order to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed to do so.
It has a wide range of application scenarios in industry and plays an increasingly important role.

Three types of topics suitable for this sub forum are as follows:
* AI Framework and AI library projects focusing on machine learning, including Mxnet, TVM, Mahout, singa, SystemML, etc
* Based on the traditional Apache big data storage and computing project, specific optimization is made in the machine learning scenario, such as spark mlib, Flink MLï¼Œetc
* Implement machine learning platform in industrial scenario based on Apache project (such as airflow + Kafka + Cassandra + spark, etc.)
