In the era of Big Data, data visualization is an important tool to help users quickly understand and explore data. At Apache Software Foundation, we have excellent visualization projects such as [Apache ECharts](https://echarts.apache.org), [Apache Superset](https://superset.apache.org), etc., which respond to the visualization needs in various scenarios.

The DataVisualization track will focus on data visualization in big data performance, interactive and animation, mobile optimization, cross-platform rendering and many other topics, and is dedicated to exploring more possibilities of data visualization.
