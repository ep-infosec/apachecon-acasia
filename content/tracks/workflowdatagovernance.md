Tools of Workflow and Data Governance can deal with complex data processing jobs, meta-data and data quality. There are a variety of projects in ASF that provide a variety of Workflow and Data Governance solutions. For example, [Apache Airflow](https://airflow.apache.org/)，[Apache Dolphin Scheduler](https://dolphinscheduler.apache.org/)，[Apache Oozie](https://oozie.apache.org/)  provide powerful data workflow platform, and  [Apache Atlas](https://oozie.apache.org/) and [Apache Griffin](https://griffin.apache.org/) provide meta data and data quality management. You will not only learn about the practical experience of first-line users in applying these Apache projects to data projects, but also learn about the latest developments in the ecology of these Apache Workflow and Data Governance projects, and visions on this project in the future.
