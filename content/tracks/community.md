Why ASF believes "Community over Code"? There is more to open source than just code contribution.

The Community track covers topics such as community governance model, growing open source project communities, diversity & inclusion, measuring community health, community management tools and data, project roadmaps, case studies, and any other topic around sustaining open source and open source communities.

We welcome you to share your community story with a broader audience.
